# RPS-Multiplayer
RPS-Multiplayer is a web app in which users can play rock, paper, scissors against other people in real time. Users can also chat with each other.

## How To Use
1. Enter a name and click the start button to become a player. If both player slots are already full, then you must wait until someone leaves to become a player.
2. Once you become a player and there is another player, the game round will begin.
3. Click on the rock, paper, or scissors icon to choose a play.
4. Rock beats paper, paper beats rock, scissors beats paper. Same plays will result in ties (i.e. Rock vs Rock).
5. Play as many times as you want. Click the leave button or leave the page to let someone else play.
6. Chat with other people by typing in the input box beneath the chatbox and then click the send button.
